# Project Description
In this project (part 1 of 2), we were tasked to build a sequence generator using a Finite State Machine (FSM).
D flip-flops were used to store the circuit's states as well as LEDs to visualize the sequences generated.
There are more details involving this project in the assignment file as well as the part 1 project report.
